							<article id="mission">
								<h2 class="major">Mission Statement</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Eating Disorder Outreach Program (EDOP) serves as a space for people with or
									without lived experience to find support and community. Through organized meetings and
									events, our group will serve as a voice of inspiration and a source of support for students in this
									community. We are a non-profit organization dedicated to honest and open conversation
									surrounding eating disorder education, reform, and advocacy.
									We hope to inform others about the realities of eating disorders - especially those that
									are misrepresented or completely excluded from traditional media through educational
									workshops and lectures. We intend to educate our peers about diet culture as a form of
									oppression and raise overall awareness about eating disorders. We also provide resources for
									those recovering from eating disorders and those supporting friends or family with lived
									experience. We plan to establish a support group for those with lived experience to find comfort
									and assist each other on their way to recovery.
									EDOP recognizes that fatphobia, body shaming, and all associated forms of diet culture
									are forms of oppression that derive from the patriarchy, misogyny, colonialism, white
									supremacy, heteronormativity, etc. and seek to silence marginalized voices. We recognize that
									certain bodies are marginalized in society and that thin privilege is the norm. We believe that
									everybody has a fundamental right to access help and treatment. In EDOP, people will find that
									they are not alone, they will have a safe outlet to express everything they’re experiencing - from
									stigma, shame and fear, and in time, recovery.</p>
